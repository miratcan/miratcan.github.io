# What Should Developers Pay Attention to When Writing a Resume?

## Your Resume Should Be in PDF Format

PDF is a distribution format. If you're sending a document for review or 
reading--not for editing--you shouldn't send it as a Word file. This is one ofthe
the basic rules of internet etiquette.

## Your Resume Should Be Free of Spelling Errors

Many resumes I come across fail to pay attention to even the simplestspelling
spelling rules. Spelling mistakes can lead to your immediate rejection.
Writing properly isn't difficult, so take the time to proofread.

## Your Resume Shouldn't Exceed One Page

Imagine being an HR representative tasked with reviewing 100 resumes int 
a day. How would you feel if you had to read a 4-page document for just one 
candidate? You'd probably start reading it with a heavy sigh, and in that 
negative mindset, it's unlikely you'd view the resume favorably.

Put yourself in the reader's shoes and try to fit everything they need to 
know into a maximum of two pages.

## Mention Things That Excite You

The person reading your resume will try to pick up clues about both your
technical skills and whether your personality fits the team.

Instead of generic phrases like "reading books" or "listening to music," 
mention something you genuinely enjoy that relates to your profession. 
Did you have fun creating a platformer game with LUA? Or was it building a 
cardboard elevator in school and making it stop at the right floor?

## Have a Github Account

When I say sharing code on Github is a plus, people often think they need to
publish a big project or library. In fact, you can share small scripts as Gists.

For example, you might share a script that calculates Fibonacci numbers, 
performs a bubble sort, or [splits a word into its syllables](https://gist.github.com/miratcan/9196ae2591b1f34ab645520a767ced17).

Sharing these gives people trying to evaluate you a great opportunity to 
understand how you think, how well you follow coding standards, and what 
details you focus on.
