title: Did I Accidentally Find God While Coding a Genetic Algorithm?

*A software developer's thought experiment from code to cosmos*

I'm building a bot that trades crypto markets automatically. Its name is Jarvis. It uses a genetic algorithm — meaning I simulate Darwin's natural selection in code. I generate hundreds of strategy "individuals," pit them against each other, the fittest survive and reproduce, the weak get eliminated. Over generations, the system optimizes itself.

It works. Beautifully.

Until it doesn't.

## The Crisis

My backtests start from 2017. The system evolves over generations, getting stronger, more profitable. Then we hit 2021 — and every single individual crashes. Total extinction.

When I investigated why, what I found made me think deeply: the system had been **eliminating** features like sentiment analysis and the fear/greed index over generations. Why? Because under normal market conditions, these features were unnecessary overhead. Extra computation, extra complexity, but near-zero contribution to profit. Natural selection is ruthless — it eliminates everything that doesn't provide an advantage.

But in 2021, those eliminated features were exactly what would have saved them. When the market was swept up in wild euphoria, an individual that could read the fear/greed index would have said "stop, this isn't sustainable." But those individuals had been eliminated generations ago.

## The Intervention

My solution: I **force-protected** certain features. I didn't leave them to evolution. In the code, I declared: "Sentiment analysis and fear/greed features **must** exist in every individual. These are not optional traits — they're core firmware."

I intervened as a designer. I protected things that seemed meaningless from the individuals' own perspective, that looked like dead weight in the short term but were critical in the big picture. Because I could see the big picture — the individuals couldn't.

After this intervention, the system survived both normal markets and crisis periods.

That's when something clicked in my head.

## Evolution Is a Brilliant Mechanism — But Is It Enough on Its Own?

Natural selection is a magnificent optimization algorithm. Over millions of years, it has adapted organisms to their environments, produced incredibly complex structures — from eyes to brains, wings to immune systems.

But it has a weakness I witnessed firsthand in my algorithm: **it gets stuck in local optima**. It selects what works now but can't anticipate future crises. It ruthlessly eliminates things that seem costly in the short term but are critical in the long run.

What if there are things in nature that "should have been eliminated but weren't"?

## Music

This is where music enters the stage.

Music is an evolutionary anomaly. Think about it: it doesn't help you survive, it doesn't feed you, it doesn't protect you from predators, it provides no direct reproductive advantage. It consumes brain power, burns energy, takes time. A feature that natural selection should have labeled "unnecessary cost" and eliminated.

But it wasn't eliminated.

In 300,000 years of human history, across every culture, every continent, every era — music exists. No civilization has ever existed without it. We find 40,000-year-old bone flutes. Even language isn't this universal — languages diverged, but the drive to produce rhythmic sound is the same everywhere.

"But music has evolutionary benefits!" you might object. I thought so too, and looked into it:

**Lullabies for babies?** A baby is crying — a simple "shh" sound works just fine. Melody is unnecessary.

**Rhythm around the campfire?** Zero survival value. Pure energy waste.

**Warning signals in danger?** A single scream is sufficient. Rhythm is unnecessary.

**Pre-hunt rituals?** No proven pragmatic benefit.

None of these explain why music **wasn't eliminated**. They only show that "a pre-existing feature was later found useful." It's a chicken-and-egg problem: did music evolve for these benefits, or was it already there and we just found uses for it?

## The Protected Feature

Let's return to Jarvis.

Sentiment analysis and fear/greed features looked unnecessary under normal market conditions. The system kept eliminating them. I intervened as a designer and protected them — because I could see the big picture.

Could music be humanity's "sentiment analysis"? In normal times — while hunting, building shelter, gathering food — it seems unnecessary. But perhaps a designer placed it there and didn't allow it to be eliminated. Perhaps in the big picture, it serves a function we can't yet fully see.

Or perhaps its function is something too large to be defined by the word "function." Perhaps music is the signature that a system is "more than just a survival machine."

## What I'm Claiming and What I'm Not

Let me be clear: I'm not saying "God exists, and I proved it." This is not proof — it's an **observation**. An analogy built from a real experience I had in my own code.

What I am claiming is this: evolution is a brilliant mechanism, but left to its own devices, it gets stuck in local optima and can't see the big picture. In my algorithm, this was plainly visible. And in nature too — with things like music — there are features that "should have been eliminated but weren't."

This doesn't prove the existence of a fine-tuner. But it deserves the question:

**Who is protecting the things that evolution keeps trying to eliminate?**
