title: I Became the Friend Who Kills Your Startup Ideas. Then I Automated Myself.
---
body:

Since 2009, I've been building side projects and writing about why they failed. [A classified ads site](../bilsin-com-ilk-girisimim/) that got 40 listings in two years. [A Reddit clone](../linkfloyd-reddit-klonu-turkiye-icin/) that accidentally became one person's music blog. [A viral curiosity engine](../cubbin-viral-buyume-sifir-retention/) with zero retention. [A lottery for websites](../sitepiyango-viral-olup-15-gunde-olmek/) killed by a single blog post in 15 days. I've built over a dozen things. Most of them died. I wrote a [retrospective on each one](/articles@tag/retrospective/), trying to extract the lesson before it faded.

Somewhere around 2016, I started [writing down rules](../o-projeyi-yapma/) for which projects to start and which to avoid. Then I became *that friend*. Someone in my circle would message me with an idea, and I'd spend 30 minutes asking uncomfortable questions until the idea either survived or didn't. This kept happening—different friend groups, different Slack channels, different coffee chats. I was watching people fall into the exact same holes I'd crawled out of years earlier.

So I built [The Slaughterhouse](https://slaughterhouse.mirat.dev/).

## What It Does

You answer six questions about your idea. An AI with the bedside manner of Dr. House runs it through 15 gates—each one a specific failure pattern I've lived through or watched someone else live through:

- **Is the pain real?** [bilsin.com](../bilsin-com-ilk-girisimim/) solved a problem nobody was actively looking to solve. I learned this one the hard way.
- **Can you describe ONE specific user?** Not "millennials" or "small businesses"—a person with a name and a habit.
- **Will they actually pay?** [cubb.in](../cubbin-viral-buyume-sifir-retention/) went viral with zero path to revenue. Turns out "viral" and "profitable" are different words.
- **How do you reach them?** [linkfloyd](../linkfloyd-reddit-klonu-turkiye-icin/) had no distribution strategy beyond "post it and hope."
- **Can you ship in a month?** If you need a year and a team of ten, you're not building a startup—you're building a corporation.
- **What happens if the platform you depend on disappears?** I lost [ffanony](../ffanony-150-satir-kod-ile-viral-olmak/) when Facebook killed FriendFeed. Gone overnight.

Each gate has three verdicts: **pass**, **bleeder** (wounded but alive), or **killer** (dead, game over). One killer and your idea is done. You get a Wordle-style grid you can share—or hide in shame.

## Why It's Brutal on Purpose

Every other validation tool is designed to make you feel good. "Great idea! Here are some tips!" That's not validation—that's a participation trophy.

When I was building my early projects, nobody told me the truth. Everyone was encouraging. Then I'd spend years on something and watch it die exactly the way someone could have predicted on day one. The kindest thing anyone could have done was to say: "This will fail, and here's why."

That's what Slaughterhouse does. In 2 minutes, instead of 2 years.

## Try It

[slaughterhouse.mirat.dev](https://slaughterhouse.mirat.dev/) — it's completely free. If your idea survives, you might be onto something. If it doesn't, I just saved you months of your life. Either way, you're welcome.
