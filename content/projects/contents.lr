This list is a bit crowded. I've been coding for over 10 years, and since childhood, I've always enjoyed creating things and using my creativity. My friends now call my projects *YAMP* (Yet Another Mirat Project), and I really like the name :)

## [Simsar](/projects/simsar/)

*Give your AI the eyes of a trader.* An MCP server providing cryptocurrency market data and 35+ technical indicators to Claude and other AI assistants.

## Kaydet

A simple journaling script I wrote for my own needs. Initially created in 2016, I turned it into a Python package in 2023:

## Eleman

A white-label job listing site with minimal dependencies. It uses Airtable as a database, is dockerized, and runs quickly. Ideal for creating and publishing job listings for your company or organization.

## Resm.in

A Q&A platform where users responded with photos. Questions like *What's in your drawer?* or *Do you have a childhood photo ID?* encouraged users to reply with pictures. Besides being fun, it also featured recipes and DIY-style photo stories. I built it using Python and Django, with MySQL and Redis for databases, and Backbone.js in a few places.

## Linkfloyd

A bookmarking and sharing service designed for following topics instead of people, aiming to bring together those with similar interests. Inspired by the need for a Reddit-like community in Turkey, it eventually developed a dedicated user base. I made lasting connections through it. Built using Python and Django, with MySQL and Redis as databases.

## Bavula Ne Koysam?

A simple web application to help create a packing list for travel. It's still [online](http://bavulanekoysam.appspot.com). I initially wrote it using App Engine, but I plan to rewrite it to function solely as a frontend application.

## Filika

A terminal application I wrote for backing up FriendFeed accounts as it was shutting down. It also downloaded all shared images and MP3s. To ensure compatibility on all users' computers, I only used standard Python libraries. It's no longer functional since FriendFeed has closed, but it may interest those working with APIs and downloads.

## FFAnony

A web service that allowed people to post anonymously on FriendFeed using an account named FFAnony. I built it as a one-night project during FriendFeed's active days. It hosted all sorts of content, from gossip and love confessions to playful banter, flirtation, and [/r/gonewild/](http://reddit.com/r/gonewild/)-style photo shares. Our people love gossip, so it became quite popular.
