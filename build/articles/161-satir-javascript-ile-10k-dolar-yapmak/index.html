<h1>Earning $10K with 161 Lines of JavaScript</h1>
<p>Recently, <a href="http://aligundogdu.com">Ali</a> and I were browsing <a href="https://flippa.com">Flippa</a>, a marketplace where people auction their apps, websites, or blogs. For those unfamiliar, it's a platform where you can buy and sell digital assets.</p>
<p>While checking out the listings, I stumbled upon a seemingly pointless website called <a href="https://timenite.com">timenite</a>. When you visit the site, it displays a countdown timer showing the time left until the next Fortnite season. Thatâ€™s literally all it does. Thereâ€™s also AdSense ads displayed above and below the timer.</p>
<p>At first glance, it seemed like just a trivial toy of a site. But then I noticed on Flippa that the site was reportedly earning $200 per month, and this revenue figure was verified by Flippa. Suddenly, this "toy" turned into something much more interesting in my eyes.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s why: the site had been live for four years, likely built in just a single weekend, required zero maintenance, and had been generating $200 per month for three of those years. Letâ€™s do the math:<br>
<strong>12 months Ã— $200 Ã— 3 years = $7,200</strong><br>
On top of that, it was listed for sale on Flippa for $3,500.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, I looked into the siteâ€™s structure and found that it was just a simple HTML page and a <a href="https://github.com/Centerpoint-Gaming/timenite/blob/main/scripts/main.js">161-line JavaScript file</a>. That was it. While writing this post, the site was already sold, so if you visit its <a href="https://flippa.com/11545762-a-4-year-old-simple-website-that-shows-a-countdown-to-the-next-season-on-fortnite-earning-2100-per-year-through-adsense-and-epic-s-support-a-creator">Flippa listing</a>, youâ€™ll get a 404 error.</p>
<p>Whoever built this site earned $7,200 from AdSense and then another $3,500 from the saleâ€”totaling $10,700.</p>
<p>Honestly, Iâ€™m jealous. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Naturally, I started digging to find out who created this. Such ideas often come from kids in those "fortunate" countries. But this time, it was different. The <a href="https://github.com/Centerpoint-Gaming/timenite">project is public on GitHub</a>, where I found out it was built by Priyam Raj. I even found his <a href="https://priyamraj.com">personal website</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out, heâ€™s a young guy living in Bangalore, India. Judging by this photo from 2009, he seems to have come from a very modest background. But despite that, he had access to computers and the internet.</p>
<p><img src="hero.jpg" alt="Photo"></p>
<p>In his own words, Priyam describes himself like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether it be a film, a book, or just a simple tool, I want to keep creating useful stuff until my time on this planet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isnâ€™t that a cool story?</p>
<p>Why am I sharing this? To challenge my own opinion. In a <a href="../../blog/yazilimci-girisimciler-nereye-gitti/">previous post</a>, I argued that the rising time and knowledge costs of software development are the reasons we donâ€™t see as many entrepreneurial developers these days. But I was wrong. You can still make something worthwhile with a good idea and a simple implementation.</p>
<p>Even if youâ€™re from a developing country.</p>
