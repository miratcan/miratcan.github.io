<h1>Snails as Pets: Why I Chose Them?</h1>
<p>I've always had a great connection with animals, and I've loved cats for as long as I can remember. My spouse also likes cats but has a phobia of them. Since we are both busy—working full time and raising a young child—I needed a low-maintenance pet. After doing some research, we decided to get a snail. Here are the advantages of keeping snails as pets:</p>

</figure><h2>Advantages of Having a Snail:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No walks required</strong>: Unlike other pets, you don’t need to take snails out for walks or clean their paws when they come back inside.</li>
<li><strong>No vet visits</strong>: There's no need for vaccinations, surgeries, or dental care like with other animals.</li>
<li><strong>No litter box issues</strong>: You don’t have to worry about accidents or changing their litter. Snails are simple to care for in this regard.</li>
<li><strong>Simple feeding</strong>: Snails feed on leftover food like cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, rocket, or eggshells. Just be sure the food isn’t contaminated with pesticides, salt, or acids (like lemon or vinegar).</li>
<li><strong>Low maintenance</strong>: If you're entering a busy season, or if you're going on vacation, adult snails can enter a hibernation mode and survive for weeks without much care.</li>
<li><strong>No escape worries</strong>: Snails don’t run away. They move slowly—only about 10 cm per minute.</li>
<li><strong>Minimal setup</strong>: All they need is a small box with holes, a little soil to crawl on, a mist of water from a flower sprayer, and a hiding spot. These can all be easily found at home.</li>
<li><strong>Affordability</strong>: You can find garden snails in the wild during autumn or buy oversized African snails for around 50-60 Turkish Lira.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s my little friend—I'm not sure how much more it will grow.</p>
